We are the Bay Area Frassati, a Catholic community of young adults helping one another support **traditional Catholic movements** in the greater Santa Clara county.
<br>
Our activities consist of **service, intellectual formation, and fellowship** across our various ministriesâ€”ranging from hikes, holy hours and dinners to debates, pilgrimages and more.
<br>
We are especially blessed to have guidance from the **SSPX**, associating ourselves with their priests to fulfill our goals.
